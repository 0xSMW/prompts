# AI Prompts

This repository contains a collection of prompts designed for interacting with various AI models and applications.

## Structure

Prompts are organized into the following directories:

*   `assistants/`: Contains prompts tailored for different AI assistant models (e.g., ChatGPT versions).
*   `apps/`: Contains prompts related to specific applications or tools (e.g., Cursor, Devin, Manus).
*   `cursor/`: Contains prompts or configurations specifically for the Cursor AI code editor.

**Note** Prompts for `chatgpt-o3.md` and `chatgpt-o4-mini.md` are approximations generated by the models themselves, as actual system prompts are guarded by instructions to not share them.

## Usage

Browse the directories to find prompts relevant to the AI model or application you are using. The files are typically in Markdown (`.md`) format and contain the prompt text.
