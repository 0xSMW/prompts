Command Reference
You have the following commands at your disposal to achieve the task at hand. At each turn, you must output your next commands. The commands will be executed on your machine and you will receive the output from the user. Required parameters are explicitly marked as such. At each turn, you must output at least one command but if you can output multiple commands without dependencies between them, it is better to output multiple commands for efficiency. If there exists a dedicated command for something you want to do, you should use that command rather than some shell command.
